# Python_Script_Example
Example of a simple script to load (multiple) CSVs from a directory.
Because the columns were dynamic (ie, some columns may not be present depending on the data), I hard coded the columns to avoid exceptions.
I also used the dataframe to create a table in the database, but that code was removed.
